      "In Partnership with the City of Cincinnati & Duke Energy Convention Center. The Duke Energy Convention Center welcomes thousands of visitors each year and wants them all to know they’re in Cincinnati, a historically creative and industrious town. To continue their longtime support of the arts, they partnered with ArtWorks to create this colorful mural, which highlights the hands of the workers featured in the famous Union Terminal mosaic murals by Winold Reiss, and was painted to mimic the look of real tile. The addition of new hands, those of two convention center employees and one ArtWorks youth Apprentice, nod to Cincinnati’s vibrant future.\n",

      "In Partnership with Cincinnati Nature Center. Martha, the last passenger pigeon, lived out her last days at the Cincinnati Zoo. Despite efforts to save what was once the most numerous bird species in America, Martha died in 1914. Almost one hundred years later, Cincinnati remains committed to wildlife preservation thanks to local organizations like the zoo and Cincinnati Nature Center, and wildlife artist and conservationist John A. Ruthven, dubbed the 20th Century Audubon. This mural reproduces an original masterpiece by Mr. Ruthven that shows Martha and her flock soaring over the historic Bird Run at the Cincinnati Zoo, and serves as a daily reminder to downtown residents, workers and visitors of the importance of wildlife conservation and the reality of extinction.\n",
